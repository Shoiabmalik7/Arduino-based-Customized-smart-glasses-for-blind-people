# Arduino-based-Customized-smart-glasses-for-blind-people
For all human beingsâ€™ vision is primary requirement to survive in fast-changing
environment. Scientific glasses are there to improve the eye sight of visually impaired 
people. But for blind people there is a need for smart glass to guide them to be independent. 
In this paper, we have proposed a method to support visually challenged people. The 
existing methods are available to identify obstacles, stair cases, water proximity separately 
as well as combined. We have extended the existing smart aid techniques for obstacle 
detection with the fire detection and also the background detection. We have developed a 
low cost solution using the input and output sensors connected through Arduino board. The 
environment in front of the subject is detected by sensors and then the signal will be sent 
to the processor. The processor will respond to the input and sends the corresponding signal 
to the output transducer. The buzzer sound or beep sound from the output transducer will 
alert the user accordingly.
The proposed model of smart glass for visually impaired enhance the features of the 
existing obstacle detection models. It is an embedded system integrating the pair of 
ultrasound transducer, flammable gas or smoke detector and Light Dependent Resistor 
(LDR) to identify the objects like obstacles, fire, smoke and darkness. The information 
obtained from sensors is given to the Arduino processor. Arduino UNO process the 
information and sends corresponding signal to buzzer. The corresponding buzzer sound 
will help the subjects to identify the objects or obstacles accordingly.
